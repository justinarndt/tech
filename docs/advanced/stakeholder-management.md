# Stakeholder Management

Technical writers work with diverse stakeholders—engineers, product managers, designers, support teams, and leadership. Success depends on building relationships, managing expectations, and navigating competing priorities.

## Understanding Stakeholders

### Key Stakeholder Groups

**Engineering:**
- Provide technical information
- Review for accuracy
- Priorities: Ship features, minimize interruptions

**Product Management:**
- Define requirements and priorities
- Approve content direction
- Priorities: User success, feature adoption

**Design:**
- Influence user experience
- Collaborate on in-app content
- Priorities: Consistency, usability

**Support:**
- Report documentation gaps
- Provide user feedback
- Priorities: Deflect tickets, resolve issues

**Leadership:**
- Allocate resources
- Set strategic direction
- Priorities: Business outcomes, efficiency

### Mapping Stakeholders

Identify influence and interest:

```markdown
## Stakeholder Map

| Stakeholder | Interest | Influence | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Engineering Lead | High | High | Close collaboration |
| Product Manager | High | High | Regular alignment |
| Support Lead | High | Medium | Feedback channel |
| Designer | Medium | Medium | Periodic check-ins |
| VP Engineering | Low | High | Status updates |
```

## Building Relationships

### With Engineers

**Understand their world:**
- Learn enough code to be credible
- Respect their time constraints
- Communicate through their tools (PRs, tickets)

**Make collaboration easy:**
- Come prepared with specific questions
- Batch requests when possible
- Follow up in writing

**Add value:**
- Catch issues before release
- Improve user-facing text in code
- Reduce support burden

**Example approach:**
```markdown
## Engineer Collaboration Pattern

Before meeting:
- Review the feature PR/spec
- Draft initial questions
- Prepare any preliminary content

During meeting:
- Ask targeted, specific questions
- Take notes (share afterward)
- Clarify technical concepts

After meeting:
- Send summary of key points
- Share draft for review
- Keep them updated on progress
```

### With Product Managers

**Align on priorities:**
- Understand roadmap and timelines
- Clarify documentation requirements
- Negotiate scope when needed

**Demonstrate value:**
- Show documentation impact on adoption
- Connect docs to user success metrics
- Proactively identify gaps

**Communicate effectively:**
- Speak in terms of user outcomes
- Provide options with trade-offs
- Flag risks early

### With Support Teams

**Create feedback loops:**
- Regular check-ins on doc quality
- Easy way to report issues
- Shared visibility into doc updates

**Understand their needs:**
- What questions do users ask?
- Which articles get shared most?
- Where do users get stuck?

**Collaborate on content:**
- Turn common tickets into documentation
- Review support articles for consistency
- Share upcoming changes

## Managing Expectations

### Setting Realistic Timelines

Be honest about capacity:

```markdown
## Documentation Estimate Template

Feature: [Feature Name]
Complexity: [Low/Medium/High]

Content needed:
- [ ] Conceptual overview (4 hours)
- [ ] Tutorial (8 hours)
- [ ] Reference (6 hours)
- [ ] Migration guide (4 hours)

Reviews required:
- [ ] Engineering review (1-2 days)
- [ ] PM review (1 day)

Dependencies:
- Final feature design
- API stability
- Access to staging environment

Estimated completion: [Date]

Notes: Timeline assumes no competing priorities.
```

### Handling Competing Priorities

When everything is urgent:

1. **Clarify true priorities**
   "If I can only complete one this week, which matters most?"

2. **Make trade-offs visible**
   "Doing A means B will be delayed until [date]."

3. **Escalate appropriately**
   "I need help prioritizing between X and Y."

4. **Document decisions**
   "Per our conversation, prioritizing A over B."

### Scope Management

Prevent scope creep:

```markdown
## Scope Agreement

### In Scope
- User guide for new feature
- API reference documentation
- Basic troubleshooting

### Out of Scope
- Video tutorials (separate project)
- Localization (Phase 2)
- Internal training (separate request)

### Dependencies
- Feature specification finalized by [date]
- Engineering review available during [dates]
- Final screenshots available by [date]

Approved by: [PM Name] [Date]
```

## Communication Strategies

### Status Updates

Keep stakeholders informed:

```markdown
## Weekly Documentation Update

### Completed This Week
- Published API reference for v2.0
- Updated installation guide with new requirements
- Resolved 5 documentation bugs

### In Progress
- Migration guide (70% complete, on track)
- New user onboarding docs (draft review this week)

### Blocked
- Feature X documentation waiting on final spec

### Next Week
- Complete migration guide
- Begin video script for onboarding

### Metrics
- Page views: +15% week-over-week
- Support tickets for documented features: -10%
```

### Review Requests

Make reviews easy:

```markdown
## Review Request

**Document**: API Authentication Guide
**Review type**: Technical accuracy
**Deadline**: [Date]

**What I need from you**:
- Verify code samples work
- Confirm API endpoints are correct
- Flag any missing security considerations

**How to provide feedback**:
- Comment directly in [link]
- Or reply to this email

**Time required**: ~15 minutes

Thank you!
```

### Giving Updates

Know what stakeholders care about:

| Stakeholder | They Want to Know |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Engineers | Is this technically accurate? |
| PMs | Will users succeed? On schedule? |
| Support | Will this reduce tickets? |
| Leadership | ROI, efficiency, outcomes |

## Handling Challenges

### Unresponsive Reviewers

```markdown
## Escalation Path

1. Direct request with deadline
2. Follow-up reminder at 50% of deadline
3. Final reminder at 90% of deadline
4. Escalate to manager with impact statement

Example escalation:
"Hi [Manager], I've requested review from [Name] three
times for the [Feature] documentation. Without approval
by [Date], we'll miss the release deadline. Can you help
unblock this?"
```

### Conflicting Feedback

When reviewers disagree:

1. **Understand the concerns**
   What's driving each perspective?

2. **Find common ground**
   What do they agree on?

3. **Propose a solution**
   "Based on your feedback, here's my recommendation..."

4. **Escalate if needed**
   Get a decision-maker to resolve

### Last-Minute Changes

When features change late:

```markdown
## Change Impact Assessment

Change: [Description]

Documentation impact:
- Pages affected: 5
- Estimated rework: 8 hours
- Screenshots needed: 12

Options:
1. Delay release 3 days for complete docs
2. Release with partial update, complete by [date]
3. Release with warning about docs in progress

Recommendation: Option 2 with prominent "docs updating" notice

Decision needed by: [Date]
```

## Building Influence
