# User Research for Documentation

User research helps you understand who reads your documentation and what they need. Without research, you're guessing. With research, you're making informed decisions.

## Why User Research Matters

### Benefits

**Better content:**
- Address real user needs
- Organize information intuitively
- Use language users understand
- Include examples that resonate

**Better decisions:**
- Prioritize effectively
- Justify investments
- Measure success
- Avoid wasted effort

## Research Methods

### Quantitative Methods

**Analytics:**
What users do at scale.

```markdown
## Analytics Insights

### Traffic Analysis
- Which pages are most visited?
- How do users navigate?
- Where do users enter/exit?
- What devices do users use?

### Search Analysis
- What do users search for?
- Which searches fail?
- What results do users click?
- How often do users refine searches?

### Engagement Metrics
- Time on page
- Scroll depth
- Bounce rate
- Return visits
```

**Surveys:**
Self-reported data from many users.

```markdown
## Documentation Survey

1. How would you rate our documentation overall?
   (1-5 scale)

2. How easy is it to find what you need?
   (1-5 scale)

3. What documentation do you use most?
   - Getting started guides
   - API reference
   - Tutorials
   - Troubleshooting
   - Other: ___

4. What's missing from our documentation?
   (Open text)

5. How could we improve?
   (Open text)
```

### Qualitative Methods

**User Interviews:**
Deep understanding from individuals.

```markdown
## Interview Guide

### Background (5 min)
- What's your role?
- How long have you used [product]?
- How technical would you say you are?

### Documentation Usage (15 min)
- Tell me about the last time you used our docs.
- What were you trying to do?
- How did you find what you needed?
- What worked well? What didn't?

### Needs and Preferences (10 min)
- What documentation format works best for you?
- What frustrates you most about our docs?
- What would make our docs better?

### Wrap-up (5 min)
- Anything else you'd like to share?
- Can we follow up if we have more questions?
```

**Usability Testing:**
Observe users completing tasks.

```markdown
## Usability Test Plan

### Objective
Evaluate findability and usability of installation documentation.

### Tasks
1. Find how to install the product
2. Determine system requirements
3. Complete installation
4. Verify installation succeeded

### Metrics
- Task completion rate
- Time to complete
- Errors and difficulties
- Satisfaction rating

### Observations
- Navigation path
- Points of confusion
- Questions asked
- Verbal feedback
```

**Card Sorting:**
Understand how users categorize information.

```markdown
## Card Sort Study

### Setup
- Create cards for each documentation topic
- Include 30-50 cards
- Open sort (users create categories)
  or closed sort (predefined categories)

### Analysis
- How do users group related topics?
- What category names do users create?
- Where do users expect to find things?
- What groupings are consistent across users?

### Application
- Inform navigation structure
- Improve labeling
- Reorganize content
```

## Conducting Research

### Planning Research

```markdown
## Research Plan Template

### Research Question
What do we want to learn?

### Method
Which method(s) will we use?

### Participants
- How many participants?
- What are their characteristics?
- How will we recruit them?

### Timeline
- Recruitment: [dates]
- Sessions: [dates]
- Analysis: [dates]
- Reporting: [dates]

### Resources
- Tools needed
- Budget
- Team involvement
```

### Recruiting Participants

```markdown
## Recruitment Approaches

### Internal
- Beta testers
- Support tickets (satisfied customers)
- Community members
- User group participants

### External
- User research platforms
- Social media outreach
- Customer success referrals
- Incentivized participation

### Screening Questions
1. How long have you used [product]?
2. How would you describe your role?
3. How often do you use documentation?
4. Are you willing to participate in [time] session?
```

### Conducting Sessions

**Interviews:**

```markdown
## Interview Tips

### Before
- Test recording equipment
- Review participant background
- Have questions ready
- Prepare consent form

### During
- Build rapport first
- Ask open-ended questions
- Listen more than talk
- Probe for details
- Note non-verbal cues

### After
- Thank participant
- Write notes immediately
- Note key quotes
- Identify themes
```

**Usability Tests:**

```markdown
## Usability Testing Tips

### Environment
- Quiet, private space
- Screen sharing setup
- Recording permission

### Facilitation
- Explain think-aloud protocol
- Give minimal guidance
- Don't lead the participant
- Note all observations

### Common Questions
- "What are you thinking?"
- "What would you expect to happen?"
- "Is that what you expected?"
- "How would you normally do this?"
```

## Analyzing Results

### Qualitative Analysis

```markdown
## Analysis Process

1. Review all data
   - Listen to recordings
   - Read notes and transcripts
   - Organize by topic

2. Identify patterns
   - Common themes
   - Repeated pain points
   - Consistent preferences
   - Divergent opinions

3. Generate insights
   - What does this mean?
   - So what? (implications)
   - Now what? (actions)

4. Prioritize findings
   - Frequency
   - Severity
   - Impact
```

### Synthesis Techniques

**Affinity Mapping:**
```markdown
1. Write observations on sticky notes
2. Group related observations
3. Name each group
4. Identify themes across groups
5. Document key findings
```

**Journey Mapping:**
```markdown
## Documentation User Journey

| Stage | Actions | Thoughts | Pain Points | Opportunities |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Aware | Search, ask | "Where do I start?" | Hard to find | SEO, in-app links |
| Learn | Read tutorials | "How does this work?" | Too complex | Simplify intro |
| Do | Follow instructions | "Did I do it right?" | Missing steps | Add verification |
| Troubleshoot | Search errors | "Why isn't it working?" | Can't find answer | Better search |
```
