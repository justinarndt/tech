Subject: Improving your developer documentation

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company]'s API documentation could use some
attention—specifically, the authentication section seems
incomplete based on common developer questions in forums.

I specialize in API documentation and have helped companies
like [Client] improve their developer onboarding by 40%.
I'd love to help [Company] create documentation that
reduces support burden and improves developer experience.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to discuss?
