# Building Your Portfolio

A portfolio demonstrates your abilities better than any resume. It shows potential employers what you can do, not just what you claim.

## Why Portfolios Matter

### What Employers Want to See

- Can you write clearly?
- Can you explain complex topics?
- Do you understand user needs?
- Can you work with technical content?
- Do you have relevant experience?

### Portfolio vs. Resume

| Resume | Portfolio |
|--------|-----------|
| Claims you can write | Shows you can write |
| Lists experience | Demonstrates skills |
| Tells what you did | Shows how well you did it |
| Gets you considered | Gets you hired |

## What to Include

### Sample Types

**Essential Samples:**

1. **Procedural/How-To**
   Shows you can write clear instructions.

2. **Conceptual/Explanatory**
   Shows you can explain complex topics.

3. **Reference**
   Shows attention to detail and completeness.

**Valuable Additions:**

- API documentation
- Tutorial with code
- Troubleshooting guide
- Restructured/improved existing docs

### Sample Selection

Choose samples that demonstrate:

```markdown
## Portfolio Coverage

| Skill | Sample Type |
|-------|-------------|
| Clear writing | Any well-written sample |
| Technical depth | API docs, developer content |
| User focus | Task-based how-to guide |
| Problem solving | Improved documentation |
| Tool proficiency | Docs-as-code project |
| Domain knowledge | Industry-specific content |
```

### Quality Over Quantity

3-5 excellent samples beat 10 mediocre ones.

Each sample should:
- Be polished and error-free
- Represent your best work
- Demonstrate specific skills
- Include context about the project

## Creating Portfolio Pieces

### From Scratch

**Document Open Source Projects:**

```markdown
## Open Source Documentation

### Finding Projects
- GitHub "good first issue" + "documentation"
- Write the Docs community requests
- Projects you use that need docs

### Process
1. Contact maintainers
2. Understand the project
3. Identify documentation gaps
4. Write and submit
5. Get feedback and iterate
6. Use in portfolio (with permission)
```

**Create Original Documentation:**

```markdown
## Original Documentation Ideas

### For Beginners
- Installation guides for tools you use
- How-to guides for processes you know
- Explanations of concepts you've learned

### For Experienced Writers
- API documentation for public APIs
- Developer tutorials for frameworks
- Architecture documentation

### Improvements
- Rewrite poor documentation
- Restructure confusing content
- Add missing sections
```

### From Experience

**Work Samples:**
- Get permission to share
- Anonymize confidential info
- Explain your specific contribution
- Include before/after if you improved existing docs

**Personal Projects:**
- Document your side projects
- Create documentation for your tools
- Write guides for your hobbies
