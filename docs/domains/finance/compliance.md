### Audit Finding Format

```markdown
# Audit Finding

## Finding ID: 2024-AML-001

## Finding Title
Incomplete Enhanced Due Diligence for High-Risk Customers

## Risk Rating: Medium

## Background
Policy POL-AML-001 requires enhanced due diligence (EDD)
for customers classified as high-risk. EDD includes
additional documentation of source of funds and expected
account activity.

is required for higher-risk customers, including documentation
of source of funds and expected account activity."

## Cause
- Lack of clear guidance on acceptable source of funds documentation
- EDD checklist not consistently used
- Insufficient supervisory review

## Effect
- Increased risk of money laundering
- Potential regulatory criticism
- Gaps in customer risk profiles

## Recommendation
1. Issue guidance on acceptable source of funds documentation
