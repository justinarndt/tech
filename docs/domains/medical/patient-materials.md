## Writing for Patients

### Health Literacy

Most adults read at 8th-grade level or below. Medical terms add difficulty:

```markdown
# Too Complex
Administer the medication subcutaneously in the anterolateral
aspect of the thigh, ensuring aseptic technique.

# Patient-Friendly
Inject the medicine into the front or side of your thigh.
Clean the area first to prevent infection.
```

### Plain Language Principles

**Use common words:**

| Medical Term | Plain Language |
|-------------|----------------|
| Administer | Give / Take |
| Adverse event | Side effect |
| Contraindication | Do not use if |
| Hypertension | High blood pressure |
| Prophylaxis | Prevention |
| Subcutaneous | Under the skin |

**Use short sentences:**

```markdown
# Long Sentence
If you experience any symptoms such as chest pain, shortness
of breath, or severe dizziness, which could indicate a serious
reaction, you should stop taking the medication immediately
and contact your healthcare provider or go to the emergency room.

# Clear and Direct
Stop taking the medicine if you have:
- Chest pain
- Trouble breathing
- Severe dizziness

Call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room.
```

**Use active voice:**

```markdown
# Passive
The medication should be taken with food.

# Active
Take this medicine with food.
```

Patients don't read—they scan:
