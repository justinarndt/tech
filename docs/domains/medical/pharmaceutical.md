# Pharmaceutical Documentation

Pharmaceutical documentation spans the entire drug lifecycle from discovery through post-market surveillance. Writers create documents that support research, manufacturing, regulatory approval, and safe product use.

## Drug Development Stages

### Discovery and Preclinical

Early-stage documentation:

- Research protocols
- Laboratory notebooks
- Preclinical study reports
- Toxicology summaries

### Clinical Development

Human testing documentation:

- Clinical protocols
- Investigator brochures
- Informed consent forms
- Clinical study reports

### Regulatory Submission

Approval documentation:

- Common Technical Document (CTD)
- Regulatory correspondence
- Response to queries
- Labeling

### Post-Market

After approval:

- Periodic safety reports
- Label updates
- Risk management plans
- Medical information responses

## Document Types

### Chemistry, Manufacturing, Controls (CMC)
