## Where to Start

If you are new to technical writing, work through these topics in order:

1. **Audience Analysis** - The foundation of all good documentation
2. **Clarity and Conciseness** - Core writing technique
3. **Document Structure** - How to organize information
4. **Task-Based Writing** - User-centered content approach
5. **Style Guides** - Consistency in practice

For experienced writers looking to level up:

- **Information Architecture** - Large-scale organization
- **Content Reuse** - Efficiency and consistency
- **Writing for Translation** - Global documentation
- **Quality Assurance** - Systematic improvement

Each topic builds on the others. Strong fundamentals create a platform for specialization in advanced techniques and domain-specific documentation.
