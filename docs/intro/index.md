## Why Start Here

Before mastering documentation tools or learning to write API references, you need to understand the fundamental purpose and principles of technical writing. These concepts inform every decision you make as a technical writer:

- **Who are you writing for?** Technical writing exists to serve users, not to demonstrate expertise.
- **What outcome do you want?** Every document should enable users to accomplish specific tasks.
- **How will it be used?** Understanding context shapes structure, style, and content decisions.

The pages in this section establish this mindset. They provide context for everything that follows in the Fundamentals, Document Types, and Tools sections.

## The Technical Writing Landscape

The demand for skilled technical writers continues to grow. Software companies, medical device manufacturers, financial institutions, and government agencies all need professionals who can translate complexity into clarity.

Key drivers of this demand include:

- **Software proliferation**: Every application, API, and platform requires documentation
- **Regulatory requirements**: Industries like healthcare and finance mandate extensive documentation
- **User expectations**: Modern users expect clear, accessible help content
- **AI integration**: New tools require new documentation approaches

Technical writing offers multiple career paths—from individual contributor roles at technology companies to freelance consulting across industries. The skills you develop are transferable and increasingly valuable.
