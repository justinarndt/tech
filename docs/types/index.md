## Choosing the Right Document Type

Different situations call for different document types:

| User Need | Recommended Type |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Learn to use a product | User Manual, Tutorial |
| Get started quickly | Getting Started Guide |
| Look up specific information | API Reference, Quick Reference |
| Solve a problem | Troubleshooting Guide, FAQ |
| Understand what changed | Release Notes |
| Evaluate a solution | White Paper, Case Study |
| Follow a procedure | SOP, Runbook |

## Document Type Selection Factors

Consider these factors when choosing document types:

**Audience**
- Who will read this?
- What do they need to accomplish?
- What do they already know?

**Purpose**
- Teaching? Reference? Troubleshooting? Decision support?
- One-time or repeated use?

**Context**
- How will users access this?
- What format works best?
- Are there compliance requirements?

## Combining Document Types

Products typically need multiple document types:

**For a SaaS application:**
- Getting Started Guide (new users)
- User Manual (comprehensive reference)
- API Documentation (developers)
- Release Notes (ongoing communication)
- Knowledge Base (support)

**For an enterprise platform:**
- Installation Guide (setup)
- Administrator Guide (management)
- User Guide (end users)
- API Reference (integration)
- SOPs (operations)
- Compliance Documentation (auditors)

Match document types to audience needs throughout the product lifecycle.
