# Technical Proposals

Technical proposals present solutions to client problems. Whether responding to an RFP (Request for Proposal) or proactively proposing services, effective proposals demonstrate understanding of the client's needs and present a compelling case for your solution.

## Proposal Purpose

Proposals aim to:

- **Demonstrate understanding**: Show you understand the client's problem
- **Present solutions**: Explain how you will solve the problem
- **Establish credibility**: Prove you can deliver
- **Justify investment**: Make the case for choosing you
- **Define scope**: Clarify what you will deliver

## Proposal Types

### Solicited Proposals

Responding to formal requests:

- **RFP** (Request for Proposal): Detailed requirements
- **RFQ** (Request for Quote): Price-focused
- **RFI** (Request for Information): Exploratory

Follow provided formats and requirements precisely.

### Unsolicited Proposals

Proactively proposing solutions:

- Identify client problems
- Propose your solution
- Initiate sales conversations

More flexibility in format but must capture attention.

### Executive Summary

Write for busy executives:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

Meridian Bank needs to modernize its API documentation to support
the 50 new integration partners expected in 2025. Current documentation
processes take 6+ weeks per partner, creating a bottleneck to growth.

We propose implementing a documentation platform and process that will:
- **Reduce partner onboarding time by 50%** (from 6 weeks to 3 weeks)
- **Decrease documentation-related support tickets by 40%**
- **Enable self-service partner onboarding**

Our team has delivered similar documentation transformations for
three financial services companies, including First National Bank
(case study attached).

**Investment**: $150,000 over 4 months
**Expected ROI**: 18-month payback based on support cost reduction

We are prepared to begin work on February 1, 2025.
```

### Understanding of Requirements

Show you understand before proposing:

```markdown
## Understanding of Requirements

### Current State

Based on our discovery conversations, Meridian Bank's documentation
challenges include:

- **Inconsistent documentation**: 5 teams maintain API docs independently
- **Outdated content**: Documentation lags releases by 2-4 weeks
- **High support burden**: 180 documentation-related tickets per month
- **Slow onboarding**: New partners require 6+ weeks to integrate

### Business Impact

These challenges affect:
- Partner acquisition (30% of prospects cite documentation concerns)
- Support costs ($25,000/month in documentation-related tickets)
- Developer productivity (20% of time spent on documentation questions)

### Success Criteria

A successful project will:
- Consolidate documentation into a single platform
- Automate synchronization with API releases
- Provide self-service onboarding for partners
- Reduce support tickets by at least 40%
```

### Proposed Solution

Explain your approach:
